# LogParsingProject
Capstone project, completed February 2023 for Fullstack Academy, involving code allowing the user to interact with pcap files in a simple, yet effective way on the command line. The project combines both Python and Linux command line skills and scripting within the code. The user is able to look for most common IPs, ports, and protocols, as well as search through HTTP information. You can print out pre-written or input-driven functions, all on the command line, using very little input. You can look at the file information listed out, or you can use the "Giant Grep" function to search for strings in the data. You need your pcap file and you're set! You're also able to reset the program at any time to test a new file, and the menus all connect to one another for a navigational and accessible program.

In order to run this python3 script, you'll need to include you OWN path to python3 at the very top line of the code. If you save it as a [scriptname].py, make it executable, and run it, the program should play out for you :)


The Contributors to this project were Alaina Koloc (Alaina the Jedi), Almir Divanovic, and Misheon McNeal.
